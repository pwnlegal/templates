## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the IASME Cyber Baseline requirements as published by IASME. In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 No active technical testing of the Client's systems is performed.

## 2. Eligibility

2.1 This Schedule is for organisations outside the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies. UK-domiciled organisations should use Schedule CE (Cyber Essentials) instead.

2.2 IASME Cyber Baseline may serve as the prerequisite for IASME Cyber Assurance (Schedule Cyber Assurance) for non-UK organisations. Confirm eligibility with the CB.

## 3. Board declaration

3.1 A senior person in the Client's organisation must confirm the accuracy of all responses before submission.

## 4. Certification validity

4.1 Certification is valid for 12 months and renewable annually.

## 5. Failed assessment and remediation

5.1 If the Assessment fails, the CB will provide a summary of issues. The Client has **14 working days** from notification to remediate and resubmit at no additional cost.

5.2 If the resubmission also fails, the Client must purchase a new Assessment at the then-current rate. No further free resubmissions are available.
