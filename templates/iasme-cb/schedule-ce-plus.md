# Schedule CE+ — Cyber Essentials Plus

*pwn.legal open-source template · CC BY 4.0*

*This Schedule applies where "Schedule CE+" is selected in the Order Form and is subject to the Standard Terms.*

---

## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the Cyber Essentials requirements version specified in the Order Form, as published by IASME. In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

## 2. Prerequisites

2.1 CE+ requires the Client to hold (or simultaneously obtain) CE basic certification under Schedule CE.

2.2 CE+ must be obtained within **90 days** of CE basic certification. If this window is missed, the Client must obtain a new CE basic certificate first.

## 3. Nature of CE+ testing

3.1 CE+ involves active technical testing of the Client's systems by the CB, including external and internal vulnerability scanning, device configuration checks, and MFA verification. The full testing methodology is described in the IASME Scheme documentation.

## 4. Testing authorisation

4.1 The Client authorises the CB to perform the testing described in clause 3 of this Schedule on all systems within the Scope.

4.2 The Client warrants that:

(a) the person signing the Order Form has authority to authorise testing of the systems within Scope on behalf of the Client;

(b) where systems are hosted on third-party infrastructure, the Client has obtained or will obtain the necessary authorisation from the relevant provider before testing commences; and

(c) the Scope accurately reflects all systems to be tested, and matches the CE basic Scope (with any agreed additions).

4.3 This testing is fully sanctioned and authorised by the Client. The Client shall not bring or support any civil claim against the CB or any member of the CB's Assessment team in respect of testing conducted within Scope. Nothing in this clause prevents either Party from cooperating with law enforcement, regulators, or fulfilling any statutory reporting obligation. Civil liability for testing outside Scope, or for breach of the Standard Terms, is governed by clause 12 of the Standard Terms.

## 5. Testing window, access, and contacts

5.1 The Order Form specifies the testing window (start date, end date, permitted hours, and any restrictions), together with emergency contacts for both Parties.

5.2 **Client cooperation.** The Client shall provide reasonable cooperation for CE+ testing, which may include whitelisting the CB's testing IP addresses, providing VPN or remote access credentials, making devices available for configuration checks, and ensuring that a technical contact is available during the testing window. Delays caused by the Client's failure to provide access may result in the testing window being extended or rescheduled, with any additional fees as specified in the Order Form.

## 6. Third-party hosting

6.1 Where systems within the CE+ Scope are hosted on third-party infrastructure, the Order Form identifies those providers and the authorisation status. The Client must obtain third-party authorisation before testing commences.

## 7. Incident during testing

7.1 If CE+ testing causes unexpected disruption to the Client's systems, the CB shall immediately halt testing and notify the Client's emergency contact. Testing shall not resume until the Client gives written consent.

7.2 If the CB discovers evidence of a pre-existing breach or active compromise during scanning, the CB shall notify the Client's emergency contact immediately. The CB will preserve scan evidence but the Client is responsible for incident response.

## 8. Failed assessment and remediation

8.1 If CE+ Assessment results in failure, the Client has **30 days** from notification to remediate. The CB will re-test remediated areas. The 30-day window is subject to the overriding 90-day CE-to-CE+ requirement — whichever deadline comes first applies.

8.2 **Patching re-test.** If the initial device sample fails patching compliance, the re-test includes both the original sample and a new random sample. If the second sample also fails, the Client's CE basic (VSA) certificate will be revoked, meaning the Client loses both CE+ and CE basic certification.

8.3 One re-test is included. Additional re-tests or a new CE+ Assessment will be charged as specified in the Order Form.

## 9. Limitations

9.1 CE+ testing identifies vulnerabilities known at the time of testing. It is a point-in-time Assessment and does not constitute a full penetration test or security audit.
