_This Schedule applies where "Schedule CE" is selected in the Order Form and is subject to the Standard Terms._

---

## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the Cyber Essentials requirements version specified in the Order Form, as published by IASME. In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 No active technical testing of the Client's systems is performed under this Schedule. For technically verified Assessment, see Schedule CE+.

## 2. Auto-fail criteria

2.1 The following result in automatic failure:

(a) any cloud service offering MFA where MFA is not enabled;

(b) any high-risk or critical security update not installed within 14 days of release; and

(c) any device connected to the internet (inbound or outbound) not included in Scope.

2.2 All cloud services storing or processing the Client's organisational data must be in Scope and cannot be excluded.

## 3. Scope

3.1 All cloud services storing or processing the Client's organisational data must be in Scope. Cloud services cannot be excluded from the Assessment boundary.

3.2 Any device connected to the internet (inbound or outbound) is in Scope.

3.3 If the CB discovers during the Assessment that the declared Scope is inaccurate or incomplete, the Assessment will be paused in accordance with clause 3.2 of the Standard Terms. The Client may need to update the scoping document and the quote may be revised.

## 4. Board declaration and ongoing compliance

4.1 The Client must procure that the Board Declaration is signed by a director or equivalent before the Assessment is submitted. The declaration includes acknowledgment of ongoing compliance responsibility throughout the 12-month certification period.

4.2 **Ongoing compliance.** Certification reflects compliance at the date of Assessment. The Client is responsible for maintaining compliance throughout the 12-month certification period. IASME may request proof of ongoing compliance at any time, and the Client must respond within **48 hours**. Material changes to the IT environment during the certification period should be notified to the CB.

## 5. Certification validity and transparency

5.1 Certification is valid for **12 months** from the date of issue and renewable annually.

5.2 **Certificate transparency.** Under v3.3, certificates include unlimited Scope descriptions and mandatory descriptions of what is out of Scope. All legal entities are identified by name, address, and company number. The Client should be aware that the Scope and exclusions are visible on the published certificate.

## 6. Failed assessment and remediation

6.1 **First failure.** If the Assessment fails, the CB will provide a summary of issues. The Client has **14 working days** from notification to remediate and resubmit at no additional cost.

6.2 **Minor issues.** Where IASME's terms apply, the Client may have **48 hours** for a free resubmission of minor issues.

6.3 **Second failure.** If the resubmission also fails, the Client must purchase a new Assessment at the then-current rate. No further free resubmissions are available.
