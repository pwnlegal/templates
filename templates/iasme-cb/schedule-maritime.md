## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the IASME Maritime Cyber Baseline requirements as published by IASME, supporting compliance with the IMO Maritime Cyber Risk Management guidelines (MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3). In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

## 2. Scope — vessel certification

2.1 This Schedule certifies a **named vessel**, not an organisation. Each vessel requires a separate Assessment. The Order Form identifies the vessel by name, IMO number (if applicable), gross tonnage, classification, and operator.

2.2 **Vessels under 500 GT** are required to complete Level 1 (verified Assessment) only. **Vessels of 500 GT or over** must complete both Level 1 and Level 2 (audited, which may involve attending the vessel).

## 3. On-board systems

3.1 The Client must provide the CB with accurate information about all networked systems on board, including navigation, communication, propulsion control, cargo management, and crew welfare systems, to the extent they are connected.

3.2 Where IT and OT networks interact, the Assessment covers both.

## 4. Certification validity and renewal

4.1 Level 2 certification is valid for three years. The vessel owner or operator must complete and pass an annual Level 1 verified self-Assessment on the first and second anniversaries.

4.2 Level 1 only (vessels under 500 GT) is valid for 12 months.

## 5. Failed assessment

5.1 If the Assessment fails, the CB provides Guidance on remediation. One free resubmission is available.
