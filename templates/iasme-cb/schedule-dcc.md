## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against DefStan 05-138 Issue 4 at the DCC level specified in the Order Form (Levels 0–3), as administered by IASME. In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 The CB must be accredited by IASME to the appropriate DCC level.

## 2. Prerequisites

2.1 DCC Level 0–1 requires the Client to hold current Cyber Essentials (basic) certification.

2.2 DCC Level 2–3 requires the Client to hold current Cyber Essentials Plus certification.

2.3 Where the Client does not yet hold the prerequisite certification, Schedule CE and/or Schedule CE+ should be completed concurrently or in advance.

## 3. Scope

3.1 DCC assesses the **organisation**, not a defined IT system or sub-set. The Scope covers all critical business operations relevant to the defence supply chain at the assessed level.

3.2 At Levels 2 and 3, the Assessment covers **139–144 controls** drawn from DefStan 05-138. This is significantly broader than Cyber Essentials and requires detailed evidence across governance, risk management, access control, personnel security, physical security, and supply chain management.

3.3 The Client should expect the Assessment process to require materially more management time and documentation than a Cyber Essentials Assessment.

## 4. On-site assessment

4.1 DCC Level 2 and 3 Assessments include an on-site component at the Client's premises. The Client shall provide the CB with reasonable access to facilities, systems, and personnel.

4.2 On-site dates, locations, and estimated duration are specified in the Order Form.

## 5. Export controls and data sensitivity

5.1 DCC clients are by definition operating in the defence supply chain. Where Assessment data or findings relate to systems processing, storing, or generating information subject to export control legislation (including the Export Control Act 2002, the Export Control Order 2008, or ITAR), the Client shall notify the CB and the Parties shall agree appropriate handling measures.

5.2 The CB shall not share Assessment data outside the IASME portal and Scheme governance framework without the Client's prior written consent, except as required by IASME and HM Government under the Scheme.

## 6. Certificate validity and annual requirements

6.1 DCC certificates are valid for **3 years** from the date of issue.

6.2 The Client must provide **annual attestation** confirming continued compliance. The CB will notify the Client in advance of each annual attestation deadline.

6.3 The Client must maintain current **CE (Levels 0–1) or CE+ (Levels 2–3)** certification throughout the DCC certificate period, requiring annual CE/CE+ recertification. Lapse of the underlying CE or CE+ certificate may result in DCC certificate suspension.

6.4 Failure to provide annual attestation or maintain CE/CE+ certification may result in DCC certificate suspension or revocation.

## 7. Failed assessment

7.1 DCC failure will be communicated with a detailed remediation report. The Client may re-engage for a fresh Assessment at the then-current rate.

7.2 No automatic re-Assessment or free re-test is included for DCC. Remediation support may be available as Guidance under the Standard Terms (clause 9).
