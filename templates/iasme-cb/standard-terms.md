*These Standard Terms govern all certification engagements between the certification body and the Client. They are incorporated by reference into each Order Form.*

## 1. Definitions

**Assessment** means the evaluation of the Client's IT infrastructure or device (as applicable) against the requirements of the applicable Scheme.

**Board declaration** means the declaration signed by a director or equivalent of the Client confirming accuracy and compliance responsibility.

**CB** means the certification body identified in the Order Form.

**Client** means the organisation or person identified in the Order Form.

**Guidance** means any advice, recommendations, or assistance the CB provides to the Client in connection with the Assessment, whether separately charged, included within the assessment fee, or informal.

**IASME** means IASME Consortium Limited.

**Order Form** means the engagement-specific document signed by the Parties, identifying the applicable Schedules, Scope, Fees, and contacts.

**Schedule** means any scheme-specific schedule applicable to the Order Form.

**Scheme** means the IASME certification scheme or schemes identified in the Order Form.

**Scope** means the systems, networks, devices, cloud services, and organisational entities within the Assessment boundary, as declared by the Client and agreed by the CB.

## 2. Scheme context

2.1 The CB operates under accreditation from IASME and is subject to IASME's quality assurance processes. Assessment decisions are subject to IASME's oversight and may be audited by IASME at any time.

2.2 The Client acknowledges that IASME and HM Government may access Assessment data for audit, quality assurance, and Scheme management purposes as required under the Scheme.

2.3 Assessment outcomes are subject to IASME's quality assurance framework, which may review or override individual Assessment decisions. The complaints procedure in clause 11 provides a mechanism for the Client to raise concerns.

2.4 **Precedence.** Where there is any conflict between these Standard Terms and IASME Scheme documentation (including the Scheme question set, technical requirements, and portal terms), the IASME Scheme documentation shall prevail in respect of certification decisions, technical Assessment requirements, and Scheme-mandated processes. These Standard Terms govern the commercial relationship between the CB and the Client.

## 3. Scope

3.1 The Client shall complete the scoping document via the IASME portal, accurately identifying all systems, devices, networks, cloud services, and legal entities within the Assessment boundary.

3.2 The Client warrants that scoping information is accurate and complete. If the CB discovers inaccuracy during the Assessment, the Assessment will be paused and an updated scoping document and revised quotation may be required.

3.3 Where the IASME portal is unavailable due to a technical outage, the CB shall notify the Client promptly and the Parties shall agree revised timelines. Neither Party shall be liable for delay caused by portal unavailability.

## 4. What certification means

4.1 Certification confirms that, at the date of Assessment, the Client's declared environment met the requirements of the applicable Scheme.

4.2 Certification does not guarantee that the Client's systems are free from vulnerabilities, nor that the Client will not suffer a security incident. It is a point-in-time Assessment against a defined standard.

## 5. Client's obligations

5.1 The Client shall:

(a) complete the IASME portal questionnaire accurately and honestly;

(b) procure that the Board Declaration is signed by a director or equivalent officer;

(c) provide timely access to all information, systems, and personnel reasonably required;

(d) notify the CB promptly of material changes to the IT environment during the Assessment;

(e) pay the fees in accordance with the Order Form; and

(f) where the Assessment involves access to the Client's systems, network traffic, logs, or device configurations, confirm that system users have been informed that monitoring or inspection may take place.

5.2 The Assessment outcome depends on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by the Client.

5.3 Where the CB discovers information during the Assessment that indicates a vulnerability, material non-compliance, or evidence of a pre-existing breach, the CB shall report this to the Client's designated contact. Only information relevant to the security Assessment will be shared with the Client under this clause. The Client shall indemnify the CB against any claim by an employee, contractor, or other system user arising from the Client's use of information discovered during the Assessment for purposes unrelated to security compliance.

## 6. CB's obligations

6.1 The CB shall:

(a) conduct the Assessment with reasonable skill and care and in accordance with IASME's requirements;

(b) maintain its IASME accreditation and all assessor qualifications throughout the engagement; and

(c) notify the Client of the Assessment outcome within a reasonable time.

## 7. Data handling

7.1 The Assessment requires submission of detailed information to the IASME portal. IASME is the data controller for portal data.

7.2 The CB shall treat all client information as confidential, making only such disclosures as are required of it under the Scheme and to the CB's personnel on a need-to-know basis.

7.3 Assessment data is retained on the portal for at least the certificate lifetime. The CB's own records will be retained for 6 years from the date of certification.

7.4 The CB shall not reference the Client by name in the CB's marketing materials or website without the Client's prior written consent. This does not affect publication of certified organisations on the IASME portal, which is administered by IASME under the Scheme.

## 8. Independence and conflicts of interest

8.1 The CB shall conduct the Assessment objectively and impartially.

8.2 Where the CB provides both Guidance and certification Assessment to the Client, the Order Form shall identify: (a) any other services the CB provides or has provided to the Client; and (b) whether the assessor making the compliance decision is the same individual who provided Guidance.

8.3 Assessment decisions shall not be influenced by any Guidance relationship. Fees for Guidance are payable regardless of whether certification is achieved.

## 9. Guidance

9.1 The Client is responsible for its own security posture, the accuracy of its Assessment responses, and maintaining compliance throughout the certification period. No Guidance provided by the CB guarantees a particular Assessment outcome.

9.2 Where the CB provides Guidance (whether separately charged or included within the Assessment fee), the CB shall perform that Guidance with reasonable skill and care. A recommendation made during Guidance does not bind the Assessment outcome.

9.3 Informal observations made outside the Scope of any service described in the Order Form do not constitute Guidance for the purposes of this agreement.

## 10. Insurance

10.1 The CB maintains insurance in accordance with IASME's requirements for accredited certification bodies. Evidence of current insurance is available on reasonable request.

## 11. Complaints

11.1 If the Client is dissatisfied with the Assessment process or outcome, it may raise a complaint with the CB, which shall respond within 10 working days.

11.2 If the complaint is not resolved to the Client's satisfaction, the Client may escalate to IASME by writing to complaints@iasme.co.uk (or such other address as IASME publishes). IASME operates its own quality assurance and complaints process, the details of which are published on the IASME website.

11.3 Nothing in this clause limits either Party's rights under clause 14.

## 12. Limitation of liability

12.1 Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which cannot be limited or excluded by law.

12.2 Subject to clause 12.1, neither Party shall be liable for loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business or goodwill, or any indirect, special, or consequential loss, however caused.

12.3 Subject to clauses 12.1 and 12.2, the CB's total aggregate liability in respect of each Order Form shall not exceed the greater of: (a) 200% of the total fees payable under that Order Form; and (b) £5,000. The cap applies separately to each Order Form and resets for each new Order Form entered into under these Standard Terms.

12.4 The limitations in this clause reflect the allocation of risk, the level of the fees, and the fact that the Client is responsible for its own security posture and implementation decisions.

12.5 Each Party's liability shall be reduced proportionately to the extent that any loss was caused or contributed to by the other Party's acts or omissions, including the provision of inaccurate or incomplete scoping information.

12.6 Neither Party may bring a claim under or in connection with this agreement more than 12 months after the date on which it became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) of the circumstances giving rise to the claim, subject to an absolute longstop of 6 years from the act or omission complained of.

12.7 Except as set out in these Standard Terms, all implied warranties, conditions, and other terms are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded.

12.8 This clause 12 survives termination.

## 13. Fees and payment

13.1 Fees are as specified in the Order Form. Invoices are payable within 30 days. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, all fees exclude VAT, which shall be payable in addition at the rate prevailing at the date of the relevant invoice.

13.2 The Order Form specifies which fee components apply (Scheme fee, CB Assessment fee, Guidance fees), their amounts, and when each becomes payable.

13.3 Where the CB provides Guidance or consultancy to the Client under a separate engagement (whether under the CB's own terms of business, a consultancy agreement, or otherwise), that separate engagement governs the Guidance or consultancy services. The Assessment and certification remain governed by these Standard Terms and the applicable Schedules. The Order Form shall identify any such separate engagement to ensure both Parties are clear which terms govern which services.

## 14. Dispute resolution

14.1 The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute through negotiation within 14 days of written notice.

14.2 If the dispute is not resolved under clause 14.1, either Party may commence proceedings in the courts of England and Wales, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

## 15. Cancellation and termination

15.1 Where the Client cancels before work commences under the Order Form, the IASME Scheme fee (if already paid) is non-refundable under IASME's terms. The CB's cancellation charges (if any) are as specified in the Order Form.

15.2 Either Party may terminate on 14 days' written notice. Where the Client terminates after work has commenced, it shall pay for work completed.

15.3 Either Party may terminate by written notice if the other commits a material breach and fails to remedy it within 14 days of receiving written notice specifying the breach.

## 16. General

16.1 **Interpretation.** In this agreement: (a) references to clauses are to clauses of these Standard Terms unless otherwise stated; (b) headings are for convenience only; (c) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa; (d) "including" and similar expressions are not words of limitation; (e) a reference to a statute is to that statute as amended from time to time; and (f) a reference to writing includes email.

16.2 **Entire agreement.** These Standard Terms and the Order Form (with applicable Schedules) constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and supersede all previous agreements, understandings, and arrangements between them relating to its subject matter. Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, representation, assurance, or warranty not set out in this agreement. Nothing in this clause limits liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

16.3 **Variation.** No variation is effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties.

16.4 **Assignment.** Neither Party shall assign its rights or obligations without the prior written consent of the other Party. Either Party shall notify the other within 14 days of any change of control. Either Party may terminate on 30 days' notice following a change of control of the other Party.

16.5 **Third parties.** No rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

16.6 **Waiver.** No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy constitutes a waiver of that right or remedy. A waiver of any right or remedy on one occasion does not constitute a waiver on any subsequent occasion.

16.7 **Severability.** If any provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

16.8 **Force majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations (other than payment obligations) where such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond that party's reasonable control, including acts of God, fire, flood, severe weather, epidemic, pandemic, war, terrorism, civil unrest, government action, power failure, failure of telecommunications networks, and third-party system outages (each a **force majeure event**). The affected party shall: (a) notify the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the nature and expected duration of the event; and (b) use reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the event. If a force majeure event continues for more than 30 days, either Party may terminate the affected Order Form on written notice, and the Client shall pay for work completed before the event. This clause does not excuse a failure to perform obligations that could have been performed notwithstanding the event.

16.9 **Confidentiality survival.** The CB's confidentiality obligations under clause 7.2 survive termination for 6 years.

16.10 **Notices.** Notices shall be in writing and sent to the address or email specified in the Order Form. A notice sent by email is deemed received on the next working day after sending.

16.11 **Electronic signature.** This agreement may be executed by electronic signature, which shall be as valid as a wet-ink signature.

16.12 **Governing law.** Governed by the laws of England and Wales.

16.13 Subject to clause 14, the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

16.14 **Survival.** Clauses 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, and this clause 16 survive termination or expiry of this agreement.
