# Schedule IoT Assurance — IoT Cyber Assurance

*pwn.legal open-source template · CC BY 4.0*

*This Schedule applies where "Schedule IoT Assurance" is selected in the Order Form and is subject to the Standard Terms.*

---

## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the IASME IoT Cyber Assurance requirements as published by IASME, covering all 13 provisions of ETSI EN 303 645 (extending beyond the three PSTI Act requirements in Schedule IoT Baseline). In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 The Order Form specifies whether Level 1 (verified Assessment) or Level 2 (audited, including hands-on testing) applies.

## 2. Scope — device certification

2.1 As with Schedule IoT Baseline, this Schedule certifies a connected device. The Order Form identifies the device by name, model number, firmware version, and connectivity description.

2.2 Each device model requires a separate Assessment unless variants share the same security architecture.

## 3. Testing authorisation (Level 2 only)

3.1 Where the CB or a subcontracted test lab performs hands-on testing of the device, the Client authorises such testing and warrants that it has authority to grant this authorisation in respect of the device and its software. This testing is fully sanctioned and authorised by the Client. The Client shall not bring or support any civil claim against the CB or any member of the CB's Assessment team in respect of testing conducted within Scope. Nothing in this clause prevents either Party from cooperating with law enforcement, regulators, or fulfilling any statutory reporting obligation.

3.2 Level 2 Assurance has been recognised by Secured by Design (a Police Crime Prevention Initiative) as meeting the required standard for the Secure Connected Device accreditation.

## 4. Relationship to Schedule IoT Baseline

4.1 Assurance certification under this Schedule satisfies and exceeds the requirements of Schedule IoT Baseline. A Client holding Assurance certification does not need separate Baseline certification.

4.2 Where a Client initially certifies to Baseline (Schedule IoT Baseline) and later seeks Assurance, the CB may credit work already completed.

## 5. Certification and renewal

5.1 Certification is valid for 12 months and is renewable annually. The Client must confirm that the device's security controls remain in place at renewal.

5.2 **Firmware and architecture changes.** Material changes to the device firmware, security architecture, or connectivity model during the certification period may invalidate the certificate and require re-Assessment. The Client must notify the CB of such changes.

## 6. Failed assessment

6.1 If the Assessment fails, the Client receives Guidance on remediation. One free resubmission is available within 30 days.

6.2 Timelines are as agreed in the Order Form. Level 2 audits involving third-party testing may require longer lead times.
