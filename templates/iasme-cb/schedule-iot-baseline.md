## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the IASME IoT Cyber Baseline requirements as published by IASME, aligned with ETSI EN 303 645 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022 (PSTI Act). In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 The Order Form specifies whether Level 1 (verified Assessment) or Level 2 (audited, including hands-on testing) applies.

## 2. Scope — device certification

2.1 This Schedule certifies a **connected device** (not an organisation). The Client is the manufacturer, importer, or distributor responsible for the device's compliance.

2.2 Each device model requires a separate Assessment. Variants of the same device may be assessed together if they share the same security architecture — the CB will confirm whether this applies.

2.3 The Order Form must identify the device by name, model number, firmware version, and a brief description of its connectivity and functionality.

## 3. Testing authorisation (Level 2 only)

3.1 Where the CB or a subcontracted test lab performs hands-on testing of the device, the Client authorises such testing and warrants that it has authority to grant this authorisation in respect of the device and its software. This testing is fully sanctioned and authorised by the Client. The Client shall not bring or support any civil claim against the CB or any member of the CB's Assessment team in respect of testing conducted within Scope. Nothing in this clause prevents either Party from cooperating with law enforcement, regulators, or fulfilling any statutory reporting obligation.

## 4. PSTI Act obligations

4.1 The Client acknowledges that PSTI Act obligations extend across the supply chain — manufacturers, importers, and distributors each have statutory duties. This Assessment covers the device; it does not assess the Client's wider PSTI compliance as an organisation.

4.2 The Client is responsible for producing and maintaining the required Statement of Compliance. Certification supports but does not replace that obligation.

4.3 **Enforcement.** Non-compliance with the PSTI Act may result in fines of up to £10 million or 4% of qualifying worldwide revenue (whichever is greater), product recalls, and daily penalties for continuing breaches.

## 5. Vulnerability disclosure policy

5.1 The Client must have a vulnerability disclosure policy in place for the device before Assessment.

## 6. Certification and renewal

6.1 Certification is valid for 12 months and is renewable annually. The Client must confirm that the device's security controls remain in place at renewal.

6.2 **Firmware and architecture changes.** Material changes to the device firmware, security architecture, or connectivity model during the certification period may invalidate the certificate and require re-Assessment. The Client must notify the CB of such changes. A minor patch that does not alter the security architecture does not ordinarily require re-Assessment, but the CB will advise if in doubt.

## 7. Failed assessment

7.1 If the Assessment fails, the Client receives Guidance on remediation. One free resubmission is available within 30 days.
