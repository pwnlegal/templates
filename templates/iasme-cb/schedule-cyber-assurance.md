# Schedule Cyber Assurance — IASME Cyber Assurance

*pwn.legal open-source template · CC BY 4.0*

*This Schedule applies where "Schedule Cyber Assurance" is selected in the Order Form and is subject to the Standard Terms.*

---

## 1. Scheme documentation

1.1 The Assessment is conducted against the IASME Cyber Assurance standard as published by IASME. In the event of conflict between this Schedule and the IASME Scheme documentation on matters of Assessment Scope, methodology, or technical requirements, the IASME documentation prevails unless otherwise agreed in the Order Form.

1.2 The Order Form specifies whether Level 1 (verified Assessment) or Level 2 (audited) applies. Level 2 audits may be conducted on-site or remotely as agreed in the Order Form.

## 2. Prerequisites

2.1 IASME Cyber Assurance requires the Client to hold a current Cyber Essentials certificate (Schedule CE). If the Client's CE certificate expires during the Assessment, the Assessment cannot proceed until CE is renewed.

2.2 **Whole-organisation Scope.** The Scope of Cyber Assurance must cover the entire organisation. Unlike Cyber Essentials, sub-set scoping is not available. The Client should ensure it is prepared for an organisation-wide Assessment before engaging.

## 3. Board declaration

3.1 The Client must designate a board member or equivalent as responsible for information security governance. The Assessment requires evidence of board-level ownership and oversight.

3.2 The Board Declaration must be signed before the Assessment is submitted.

## 4. Certification validity and renewal

4.1 **Level 1** is valid for 12 months from the date of certification. Annual resubmission is required.

4.2 **Level 2** is valid for **3 years**, subject to: (a) maintaining a current CE certificate throughout; and (b) completing the Level 1 verified Assessment annually on the first and second anniversaries.

4.3 Failure to maintain the prerequisite CE certificate during the Cyber Assurance certification period invalidates the Cyber Assurance certificate.

## 5. Failed assessment and remediation

5.1 **Level 1.** If the Assessment fails, the Client has **2 working days** to address issues and resubmit at no additional cost. The CB will re-mark within 3 working days of resubmission.

5.2 If the resubmission fails, the Client must purchase a new Assessment.

5.3 **Level 2.** The CB will issue a findings report. Remediation timescales will be agreed in writing.
