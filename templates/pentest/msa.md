## 2. Engagement structure

2.1 This agreement establishes the overarching terms governing the relationship between the Parties. Individual Testing engagements shall be governed by SOWs entered into under this agreement. Each SOW, together with its Authorisation to Test, any Physical Testing Authorisation Schedule, and any annexes, forms a separate engagement governed by the terms of this agreement.

2.2 In the event of conflict between a SOW and this agreement, this agreement prevails unless the SOW expressly states otherwise and is signed by both Parties.

2.3 Testing shall not commence under any SOW until: (a) the SOW has been signed by both Parties; (b) the Authorisation to Test has been signed by the Client's authorised signatory; (c) where physical Testing is in scope, the Physical Testing Authorisation Schedule has been signed; (d) the Client has confirmed in writing that all third-party consents required under the SOW have been obtained; and (e) any advance payment required under the SOW has been received.

2.4 The scope of each engagement is limited to the In-Scope Systems, Permitted Activities, and Testing Window defined in the relevant SOW. Any expansion of scope requires a signed Change Order referencing the applicable Authorisation. The Tester shall not undertake any Testing outside the defined scope. The Client shall not direct, request, or encourage the Tester to test outside the defined scope without a signed Change Order.

## 3. Authorisation

3.1 The Client warrants and represents that:

(a) it is the owner of, or has the legal authority to authorise Testing of, the In-Scope Systems, and the person signing each Authorisation to Test has authority to grant such Authorisation on behalf of the Client;

(b) the Authorisation extends to all Permitted Activities in the relevant SOW, including activities carried out using automated scanners, Autonomous Tools, or scripted exploitation techniques;

(c) the In-Scope Systems do not include any systems, infrastructure, or services owned or operated by a third party, except where identified in the SOW and where the Client has obtained the necessary Authorisation from that third party;

(d) where wireless Testing is in scope, the Client has the right to control the operation and use of the relevant wireless systems and consents to the interception and monitoring of communications on those systems for the purposes of Testing;

(e) where physical Testing is in scope, the Client is the occupier or has the occupier's authority to permit the Tester's physical access and activities described in the Physical Testing Authorisation Schedule;

(f) it has obtained all internal approvals necessary to permit Testing, including (where applicable) from its board of directors, information security team, and any relevant data protection officer;

(g) to the extent that Testing may involve the interception or monitoring of network traffic on the In-Scope Systems, the Client: (i) is the relevant person (within the meaning of the Investigatory Powers (Interception by Businesses etc. for Monitoring and Record-keeping Purposes) Regulations 2018) in respect of those systems; and (ii) has made all reasonable efforts to inform every person who may use the In-Scope Systems that communications may be intercepted, by means of an acceptable use policy or equivalent notification, so as to satisfy the conditions for lawful interception under those Regulations; and

(h) where In-Scope Systems contain or provide access to Personal Data (including special category data or criminal offence data), the Client has a lawful basis for permitting the Tester to process that data incidentally in connection with Testing, and has identified any data sensitivity considerations in the SOW.

3.2 The Client acknowledges that Testing conducted within scope and in accordance with the SOW is fully sanctioned and authorised by the Client. The Client shall not bring or support any civil claim against the Tester or any member of the Tester's team in respect of Testing conducted within scope. Nothing in this clause prevents either Party from cooperating with law enforcement, regulators, or fulfilling any statutory reporting obligation.

3.3 The Tester shall not conduct any Testing outside the scope defined in the relevant SOW and Authorisation to Test. If the Tester inadvertently accesses a system outside scope, the Tester shall immediately cease such access, notify the Client, and document the incident in accordance with clause 11.

3.4 The Client shall indemnify the Tester against all losses, costs, claims, and liabilities arising from: (a) any inaccuracy in the warranties in clause 3.1; (b) the Client's failure to obtain necessary third-party consents; (c) any claim by a third party that Testing of In-Scope Systems constitutes unauthorised access; (d) any claim by an employee, contractor, or other user of the In-Scope Systems in connection with Testing, to the extent arising from the Client's failure to comply with clause 3.1(g); or (e) any proceedings arising from the Client's use of information discovered during Testing for employment, disciplinary, or regulatory purposes.

3.5 Where Testing involves social engineering or impersonation of any kind (whether physical, remote, or by electronic communication), the Client shall not use the Testing Results or the Report to take disciplinary, contractual, or other adverse action against any individual who was the subject of, or responded to, such Testing. This clause does not prevent the Client from using the Testing Results for the purpose of improving its security awareness training or policies generally.

## 4. Tester's obligations

4.1 The Tester shall:

(a) conduct Testing with reasonable skill and care and in accordance with the relevant SOW;

(b) conduct Testing only within the scope, methodology, and Testing Window defined in the relevant SOW;

(c) deploy Key Personnel as specified in the SOW and not substitute them without the Client's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld);

(d) use reasonable endeavours to minimise disruption to the Client's systems and operations;

(e) deliver a Report within the timeframe specified in the SOW;

(f) comply with the DPA; and

(g) encrypt all Testing Results in transit and at rest.

4.2 The Tester may adjust the pace, sequencing, or technical approach of Testing where professional judgment indicates that adjustment is necessary for stability, safety, or legal compliance. Such adjustments do not constitute suspension under clause 11.5 and do not require the Client's prior consent, though the Tester shall inform the Client where the adjustment materially affects the Testing Window or scope coverage.

4.3 The Tester does not guarantee that Testing will not cause disruption to the In-Scope Systems.

## 5. Testing tools

5.1 The Tester shall:

(a) identify in the SOW the material tools, scanners, and platforms to be used during Testing;

(b) configure all tools to operate within the scope of the Authorisation;

(c) log tool activity in sufficient detail to support audit, incident investigation, and reporting;

(d) where the Tester deploys any Autonomous Tool, maintain qualified human oversight with the ability to intervene in or terminate its operation at any time; and

(e) not permit any Autonomous Tool to escalate privilege, pivot to new systems, exfiltrate data, or modify live data without prior human approval, unless expressly permitted in the SOW.

5.2 The Tester remains fully responsible for all actions of tools deployed under this agreement, whether or not those actions were specifically directed by a human operator.

5.3 The Tester shall not permit Testing data to be used to train, fine-tune, or improve any machine learning model without the Client's prior written consent. Testing data processed by any tool is subject to the destruction obligations in clause 12 and the DPA. The Tester shall not permit data from one client's engagement to persist in any tool's memory, context, or retrieval system in a manner accessible during a subsequent engagement for a different client.

5.4 Findings identified by automated tools may require independent verification by the Client before remedial action is taken. The Tester does not warrant that findings generated by automated tools are free from false positives.

## 6. Client's obligations

6.1 The Client shall:

(a) complete each SOW, Authorisation to Test, and any Physical Testing Authorisation Schedule accurately and in full, and promptly notify the Tester of any changes to the In-Scope Systems or Testing constraints;

(b) designate a primary point of contact with authority to make decisions regarding Testing, including the authority to request that Testing be paused or terminated;

(c) provide any Credentials required for authenticated Testing securely and in accordance with the SOW;

(d) make the Testing environment available during agreed Testing Windows;

(e) create and maintain adequate backups of all In-Scope Systems before Testing commences;

(f) not conduct or permit any other penetration test or similar security Testing against the In-Scope Systems during the Testing Window without the Tester's prior written agreement; and

(g) pay the Fees in accordance with clause 7.

6.2 The Client acknowledges and accepts that: (a) penetration Testing carries inherent risk of disruption, which may occur despite the exercise of reasonable skill and care; (b) Testing identifies Vulnerabilities known to and detectable by the Tester at the time of Testing and does not guarantee the identification of all Vulnerabilities; (c) new Vulnerabilities may emerge after Testing; and (d) the effectiveness of Testing depends on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by the Client.

## 7. Fees and payment

7.1 The Client shall pay the Fees specified in each SOW in accordance with the payment terms set out in that SOW. Unless otherwise specified, invoices shall be payable within 30 days of the date of invoice.

7.2 Unless otherwise stated in the relevant SOW, all Fees are exclusive of VAT, which shall be payable in addition at the rate prevailing at the date of the relevant invoice.

7.3 If the Client fails to make any payment by the due date, the Tester may (without limiting any other remedy): (a) charge interest at 4% per annum above the Bank of England base rate, compounding quarterly; and (b) suspend performance of all SOWs until payment is received in full.

7.4 Where additional work is required beyond the scope of an existing SOW, such work shall be subject to a Change Order or new SOW, agreed in advance.

7.5 **Cancellation and postponement.** Where the Client cancels or postpones a scheduled engagement:

(a) less than 5 working days' notice: 100% of the Fees;

(b) 5 to 10 working days' notice: 50% of the Fees;

(c) more than 10 working days' notice: no charge.

Postponement charges shall be credited against the Fees for the rescheduled engagement, provided it commences within 90 days.

## 8. Re-testing

8.1 Re-Testing is not included in the Fees unless expressly specified in the SOW. Where the SOW includes re-Testing, one round of targeted re-Testing of findings rated high or critical in the Report shall be conducted within 90 days of Report acceptance (whether express or deemed under clause 8.4).

8.2 Re-Testing is limited to verifying that specific Vulnerabilities identified in the Report have been remediated. It does not constitute a new penetration test.

8.3 Additional re-Testing shall be charged at the day rate specified in the SOW.

8.4 **Report acceptance.** The Report shall be deemed accepted 10 working days after delivery, unless the Client notifies the Tester in writing of specific deficiencies within that period. Where the Client notifies deficiencies, the Tester shall address them within a reasonable time, and the Report shall be deemed accepted 5 working days after delivery of the revised Report.

## 9. Intellectual property

9.1 **Testing Results.** All intellectual property rights in the Testing Results shall vest in the Client upon payment of the Fees in full. Until payment is received in full, the Testing Results remain the property of the Tester. Where Testing Results are shared with the Client before payment (including interim findings, screenshots, or verbal briefings), the Client has a limited licence to use those results for internal remediation purposes only. That interim licence is revocable by the Tester on written notice if the Fees remain overdue by more than 30 days, and terminates automatically on vesting of the intellectual property rights upon payment.

9.2 **Report.** Copyright in the Report (as a literary work) shall remain with the Tester. Subject to payment of the Fees in full, the Tester grants the Client a non-exclusive, perpetual licence to use, copy, and share the Report for the Client's internal purposes, including sharing with the Client's group companies, auditors, regulators, insurers, legal advisors, and prospective acquirers or investors conducting due diligence. The licence in this clause does not take effect until the Fees have been paid in full.

9.3 **Restrictions on forwarding.** The licence in clause 9.2 does not extend to sharing the Report with any other penetration Testing firm for the purpose of competing with or replacing the Tester's services, without the Tester's prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Client may share the Report with managed security service providers, incident response firms, and other security providers acting on the Client's behalf and subject to confidentiality obligations.

9.4 **Withholding.** The Tester is not obliged to deliver the Report or any other deliverable under a SOW until the Fees due in respect of that SOW have been paid in full or payment arrangements have been agreed in writing.

9.5 **Suspension for non-payment.** Where the Tester has delivered the Report and the Client subsequently fails to pay, and the Fees remain overdue by more than 30 days, the Tester may by written notice: (a) suspend the licence granted under clause 9.2; and (b) require the Client to cease all active use of the Report pending payment. The Client may retain a copy of the Report solely to the extent required by law, regulation, or contractual obligation to a third party (including audit and regulatory compliance). The licence shall automatically reinstate upon payment of all outstanding Fees.

9.6 **Tools and methodology.** The Tester's Testing tools, scripts, methodologies, and proprietary techniques remain the property of the Tester. Nothing in this agreement assigns or licences any right in the Tester's tools or methodology to the Client.

9.7 **Anonymised data.** The Tester may use anonymised and aggregated data derived from Testing (from which the Client and its systems cannot be identified) for internal benchmarking, research, and development.

## 10. Confidentiality

10.1 **Confidential Information** means all information disclosed by one Party to the other in connection with this agreement, including the Testing Results, the Client's systems architecture and security posture, and the Tester's proprietary methodologies and tools.

10.2 Each Party shall: (a) keep the other Party's Confidential Information strictly confidential; (b) not disclose it without prior written consent; and (c) not use it for any purpose other than performance of this agreement.

10.3 The obligations in clause 10.2 do not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available other than through breach of this agreement; (b) was lawfully in the receiving Party's possession before disclosure; (c) is independently developed without reference to the disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or regulation, provided that the receiving Party gives reasonable prior notice where permitted.

10.4 Each Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, officers, advisors, and sub-contractors who need to know it, provided they are bound by obligations of confidentiality at least as onerous as those in this agreement.

10.5 **Third-Party Vulnerability Information.** A Vulnerability in third-party software or hardware discovered during Testing is not proprietary to the Client and is not the Client's Confidential Information. The Tester may Report such Vulnerabilities to the affected vendor, the NCSC, CERT/CC, or an equivalent coordination body, provided that: (a) the Tester notifies the Client before disclosure; (b) the Tester does not disclose the Client's identity, systems, or any information from which the Client could be identified; and (c) the Tester allows not less than 14 days for the Client to raise concerns about timing or operational impact. If the Client wishes to request a delay, it must provide written reasons within the 14-day period. If the Client does not respond within 14 days, the Tester may proceed. The Tester shall consider the Client's concerns in good faith, but the Client may not prevent or delay disclosure beyond 90 days from the Tester's initial notification, unless a court order or legal duty requires otherwise. Where delay would create an immediate risk to public safety or the security of other organisations, the Tester may disclose without prior notice to the Client but shall notify the Client as soon as practicable afterwards.

10.6 Nothing in this agreement restricts the Tester's freedom to conduct independent security research.

10.7 The Tester shall not reference the Client by name as a customer of its penetration Testing services without the Client's prior written consent.

10.8 The obligations in this clause 10 survive termination for a period of 6 years, except that obligations relating to trade secrets continue indefinitely and clause 10.5 survives without time limit.

## 11. Incident response

11.1 If at any time during Testing:

(a) the Tester causes or suspects that it has caused unintended disruption to the In-Scope Systems or any other system;

(b) the Tester accesses or suspects that it has accessed a system outside the agreed scope;

(c) the Tester discovers evidence of a pre-existing security breach or active compromise by a third party; or

(d) any other event occurs that may require immediate action,

the Tester shall notify the Client's designated point of contact by the most expeditious means available. For service outage or out-of-scope access, the Tester shall immediately halt Testing.

11.2 The Tester shall provide a written incident Report within 48 hours.

11.3 Where the Tester discovers a pre-existing breach, the Tester shall: (a) where technically practicable, preserve relevant evidence; (b) not modify or delete any logs or evidence without the Client's Authorisation; and (c) cooperate with the Client's incident response process.

11.4 The Client may request that Testing be paused or terminated at any time. The Tester shall comply as soon as reasonably practicable.

11.5 The Tester may suspend Testing where it considers it necessary for operational, technical, legal, or safety reasons. If suspension continues for more than 14 days, the Client may terminate the relevant SOW without liability for uncompleted work.

11.6 Testing shall not resume after service outage, out-of-scope access, or discovery of a pre-existing breach until the Client gives written consent.

## 12. Post-test obligations

12.1 Following completion of each SOW, the Tester shall: (a) remove all artefacts created during Testing; (b) securely destroy or return all Credentials within 7 days; and (c) confirm cleanup in writing.

12.2 The Tester shall securely destroy all test artefacts and working data (other than the final Report) within 30 days of Report acceptance or SOW termination, whichever is first.

12.3 The final Report shall be retained for 6 years from delivery, unless the Client requests earlier destruction.

12.4 On request, the Tester shall provide a certificate of destruction.

## 13. Insurance

13.1 Each Party shall maintain such insurance as is reasonable and customary for a business of its size and nature. The Tester shall specify its insurance coverage in each SOW.

## 14. Data protection

14.1 Any processing of Personal Data under this agreement is incidental to Testing. The Tester acts as processor; the Client acts as controller.

14.2 The data processing terms are set out in the DPA, which is incorporated into this agreement. In the event of conflict, the DPA prevails.

## 15. Sensitive data and export controls

15.1 Where In-Scope Systems contain or provide access to special category data, criminal offence data, or data subject to professional or statutory confidentiality obligations, the Client shall identify this in the SOW and the Parties shall agree appropriate handling measures before Testing commences.

15.2 Where Testing involves systems processing, storing, or generating information subject to export control legislation, the Client shall notify the Tester in the SOW and the Parties shall agree appropriate handling measures.

15.3 The Tester shall not export or transfer Testing Results or reports to any person or jurisdiction where to do so would breach applicable export control legislation.

## 16. Limitation of liability

16.1 Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which cannot be limited or excluded by law.

16.2 Subject to clause 16.1, neither Party shall be liable for loss of profits, revenue, business, anticipated savings, or goodwill, or for indirect, special, or consequential loss, however caused.

16.3 Subject to clauses 16.1 and 16.2, the Tester's total aggregate liability under or in connection with each SOW shall not exceed the greater of: (a) 200% of the Fees payable under that SOW; and (b) £10,000. The cap applies separately to each SOW and resets for each new SOW entered into under this agreement.

16.4 The Client's liability under the indemnity in clause 3.4 is not subject to the limitations in this clause.

16.5 Each Party's liability shall be reduced proportionately to the extent that any loss was caused or contributed to by the other Party's acts or omissions, including the provision of inaccurate or incomplete information.

16.6 Neither Party may bring a claim under or in connection with this agreement more than 12 months after the date on which it became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) of the circumstances giving rise to the claim, subject to an absolute longstop of 6 years from the act or omission complained of.

## 17. Term and termination

17.1 This agreement commences on the date above and continues for an initial period of 12 months, renewing automatically for successive 12-month periods unless either Party gives not less than 90 days' written notice before the end of the then-current term.

17.2 Either Party may terminate immediately if: (a) the other commits a material breach not remedied within 30 days of written notice; (b) the other becomes insolvent or ceases to carry on business; or (c) the other undergoes a change of control reasonably considered adverse.

17.3 Either Party may terminate an individual SOW on 14 days' notice. Where the Client terminates, it shall pay for work completed and irrecoverable costs reasonably incurred.

17.4 On termination: (a) the Tester shall cease Testing; (b) carry out post-test obligations under clause 12; (c) deliver any reports for completed Testing; and (d) where Testing has commenced but not completed, deliver a summary of findings to date within 10 working days.

17.5 Clauses 3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and this clause 17.5 survive termination.

## 18. General

18.1 **Entire agreement.** This Agreement (together with all SOWs and their associated Authorisations to Test and any Physical Testing Authorisation Schedules, the DPA, and any surviving pre-engagement NDA) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all previous agreements, understandings, and arrangements between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter. Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance, or warranty not set out in this agreement. Nothing in this clause limits liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

18.2 **Variation.** No variation is effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties.

18.3 **Assignment.** Neither Party shall assign, transfer, sub-contract, or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), except that the Tester may sub-contract to qualified personnel, remaining responsible for their acts. A change of control of either Party shall be notified to the other Party within 14 days and shall entitle the other Party to terminate this agreement on 90 days' written notice.

18.4 **Third parties.** A person who is not a Party to this agreement has no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms. The Parties may rescind, vary, or terminate this agreement without the consent of any person who is not a Party.

18.5 **Waiver.** No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy constitutes a waiver of that right or remedy. A waiver of any right or remedy on one occasion does not constitute a waiver on any subsequent occasion.

18.6 **Severability.** If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

18.7 **Force majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations (other than payment obligations) where such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond that party's reasonable control, including acts of God, fire, flood, severe weather, epidemic, pandemic, war, terrorism, civil unrest, government action, power failure, failure of telecommunications networks, and third-party system outages (each a **force majeure event**). The affected Party shall: (a) notify the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the nature and expected duration of the event; (b) use reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the event; and (c) resume performance as soon as the event ceases. If a force majeure event continues for more than 60 days, either Party may terminate the affected SOW on written notice, and the Client shall pay for work completed before the event. This clause does not excuse a failure to perform obligations that could have been performed notwithstanding the event.

18.8 **Notices.** Notices shall be in writing and sent to the address or email specified in the relevant SOW. A notice sent by email is deemed received on the next working day after sending.

18.9 **Electronic signature.** This agreement may be executed by electronic signature, which shall be as valid as a wet-ink signature.

18.10 **Governing law.** This agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction.
