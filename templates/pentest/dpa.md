**DATE:** `[DATE]`

**PARTIES**

(1) `[CLIENT NAME]` (the **Controller** or **Client**).

(2) `[TESTER NAME]` (the **Processor** or **Tester**).

**BACKGROUND**

(A) This Data Processing Agreement (**DPA**) supplements the Master Services Agreement dated `[DATE]` between the Parties (the **MSA**). Capitalised terms not defined here have the meanings given in the MSA.

(B) The Tester may incidentally process Personal Data when performing penetration Testing of the Client's systems. This DPA sets out the terms of such processing in compliance with Article 28 of the UK GDPR.

(C) Any processing of Personal Data under the MSA is incidental to Testing and not its primary purpose.

**AGREED TERMS**

## 1. Scope and details of processing

1.1 This DPA applies to the extent that the Tester processes Personal Data as a processor on behalf of the Client in connection with Testing.

1.2 The details of processing:

(a) **Subject matter and duration:** penetration Testing of the In-Scope Systems for the duration of each SOW;

(b) **Nature and purpose:** identification and verification of Vulnerabilities, during which Personal Data may be incidentally encountered, accessed, processed, or provided access to;

(c) **Types of Personal Data:** dependent on In-Scope Systems and not fully determinable in advance, but may include names, email addresses, usernames, IP addresses, user credentials, and any other Personal Data residing in or accessible from those systems; and

(d) **Categories of data subjects:** dependent on In-Scope Systems, but may include the Client's customers, employees, contractors, suppliers, and other users.

## 2. Tester's obligations as processor

2.1 The Tester shall:

(a) process Personal Data only on the Client's documented instructions (constituted by the MSA, relevant SOW, and Authorisation to Test), unless required by law, in which case the Tester shall inform the Client before processing (to the extent permitted);

(b) bind all authorised persons by confidentiality obligations no less onerous than this DPA;

(c) implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures, including as a minimum: (i) encryption in transit and at rest; (ii) access controls limited to authorised personnel; and (iii) secure deletion procedures;

(d) engage Sub-processors only in accordance with clause 5;

(e) assist the Client with data subject rights requests under Chapter III of the UK GDPR;

(f) assist with the Client's obligations under Articles 32–36 (security, breach notification, DPIAs, prior consultation);

(g) at the Client's election, delete or return all Personal Data on termination, and delete copies unless law requires retention, certifying deletion on request; and

(h) make available information to demonstrate compliance and allow for audits under clause 7.

## 3. Penetration testing-specific data handling

3.1 **Data minimisation.** The Tester shall not extract, copy, exploit, or otherwise process Personal Data beyond what is reasonably necessary to identify and confirm a Vulnerability and to evidence it in the Report. Where a Vulnerability can be evidenced without reproducing Personal Data (for example, by using a redacted screenshot or structural reference), the Tester shall use that method.

3.2 **Incidental access protocol.** Where the Tester gains access to Personal Data during Testing that goes beyond what was reasonably anticipated in the SOW:

(a) the Tester shall notify the Client's designated point of contact promptly;

(b) the Tester shall not copy, download, or retain the data unless specifically instructed or reasonably necessary to evidence a Vulnerability;

(c) any Personal Data captured shall be handled under the security measures in clause 2.1(c) and destroyed under clause 4; and

(d) the Report shall note that Personal Data was encountered, its general nature, and the circumstances, but shall not reproduce Personal Data except to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence a Vulnerability.

3.3 **Credential handling.** Credentials discovered during Testing:

(a) shall be masked or hashed in the Report so recipients cannot reconstruct them;

(b) originals shall be securely destroyed within 7 days of the relevant Testing round; and

(c) the Report shall recommend affected credentials be rotated.

3.4 **Special category and criminal offence data.** Where the In-Scope Systems may contain special category data (Article 9 UK GDPR) or criminal offence data (Article 10 UK GDPR):

(a) the Client shall identify this risk in the SOW;

(b) the Tester shall not extract, copy, or retain any such data unless strictly necessary to evidence a Vulnerability, and shall redact it from the Report wherever possible;

(c) where special category data is encountered incidentally, the Tester shall notify the Client immediately and follow the Client's instructions on handling; and

(d) the Tester shall implement additional technical safeguards proportionate to the sensitivity of the data, which may include isolated Testing environments, enhanced access controls, and expedited destruction timescales agreed in the SOW.

3.5 **Pre-existing breach discovery.** Where evidence of a pre-existing breach or active compromise is discovered, the Tester shall immediately notify the Client's designated security contact and, where reasonably practicable, preserve relevant evidence without modifying, deleting, or removing any logs.

## 4. Data retention and destruction

4.1 Test artefacts and working data containing Personal Data shall be securely destroyed within 30 days of Report acceptance (as defined in MSA clause 8.4) or SOW termination, whichever is first.

4.2 The final Report shall be retained for 6 years from delivery.

4.3 Client-provided Credentials shall be securely destroyed or returned within 7 days of Testing completion.

4.4 The Tester shall provide a certificate of destruction on request, recording what was destroyed, the method and date of destruction, and the person responsible.

## 5. Sub-processors

5.1 Where the Tester engages a **Sub-processor**:

(a) the Sub-processor shall be bound by written data protection obligations no less onerous than this DPA;

(b) the Tester remains fully liable for the Sub-processor; and

(c) the Tester shall inform the Client of any intended addition or replacement, giving not less than 30 days to object. If the Client objects on reasonable grounds and the Parties cannot resolve it, the Client may terminate the relevant SOW.

5.2 Current Sub-processors are listed in the Annex and updated on request.

## 6. Personal Data breaches

6.1 **Breach of Client data during Testing.** The Tester shall notify the Client without undue delay, and within 48 hours, of becoming aware of any Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed under the MSA, providing (to the extent available): (a) nature of the breach and approximate numbers; (b) likely consequences; and (c) measures taken or proposed.

6.2 **Breach of Tester's own systems.** If the Tester's own infrastructure (Testing workstations, report servers, cloud storage, or communications channels) is compromised and Client data may be affected, the Tester shall: (a) notify the Client without undue delay and within 48 hours, providing the information specified in clause 6.1 to the extent available; and (b) identify what Client data may have been exposed.

6.3 The Tester shall provide reasonable cooperation to enable the Client to comply with its obligations under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK GDPR in respect of any breach notified under this clause 6.

## 7. Audit rights

7.1 The Client may audit the Tester's compliance with this DPA on 30 days' written notice, no more than once per year (save where required by law or regulation).

7.2 The Tester shall provide, on request: (a) a current SOC 2 Type II report, ISO 27001 certificate, or (where neither is held) such other evidence of its security practices as is reasonable in the circumstances, which may include a Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus certificate, a completed security questionnaire, a summary of the Tester's information security policies, or an independent assurance letter; and (b) responses to the Client's written data protection questionnaire within 30 days.

7.3 Where documentary evidence under clause 7.2 is insufficient for the Client's regulatory requirements, the Client may conduct an on-site audit at its own cost, during business hours, on reasonable notice, and subject to reasonable measures to minimise disruption to the Tester's business and to protect other clients' confidential information.

## 8. International transfers

8.1 The Tester shall not transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom unless: (a) the destination country or territory has been designated as providing an adequate level of data protection; (b) appropriate safeguards are in place (such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or binding corporate rules); or (c) a permitted derogation applies.

8.2 Where the Tester intends to transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom, the Tester shall notify the Client before the transfer and confirm that the applicable transfer mechanism is in place.
