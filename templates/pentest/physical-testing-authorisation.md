## Authorisation

1\. I, the undersigned, confirm that I am authorised to grant this Authorisation on behalf of `[CLIENT NAME]` (the **client**) and that I hold the position of `[POSITION]`. I am the occupier of the premises identified below, or have the occupier's authority to permit the activities described in this schedule.

2\. I hereby authorise `[TESTER NAME]` (the **Tester**) and the named personnel below to attend the Client's premises and conduct physical Testing as described in this schedule, during the Testing Window specified in the SOW.

3\. Where rogue devices (USB, network taps, rogue access points) are deployed, Authorisation for computer access is governed by the Authorisation to test.

4\. If tester personnel are detained or challenged by the Client's security staff, law enforcement, or any other person, the Client's emergency contact will immediately confirm the Authorisation. The Tester's personnel shall cooperate fully and identify themselves if challenged.

5\. The Client shall provide the Tester with a letter of Authorisation on the Client's headed paper, confirming the Tester's permission to be on the premises, to be carried by tester personnel at all times during physical Testing.

6\. Where the Tester has deployed devices or other physical artefacts during Testing, the Client shall permit the Tester reasonable access to the premises within 7 working days of the Testing Window closing for the purpose of retrieving and removing those artefacts.
