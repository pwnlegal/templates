## Authorisation

1\. I, the undersigned (the **authorised signatory**), confirm that I have the authority to grant this Authorisation on behalf of `[CLIENT NAME]` (the **client**) and that I hold the position of `[POSITION]` within the Client's organisation.

2\. I hereby authorise `[TESTER NAME]` (the **Tester**) and its personnel (including any automated tools, Autonomous Tools, or scripted exploitation techniques deployed by the Tester as identified in the SOW) to conduct the Testing described in the SOW referenced above on the In-Scope Systems identified in that SOW, during the Testing Window specified in that SOW, and in accordance with the Permitted Activities and subject to the Prohibited Activities described in that SOW.

3\. This Testing is fully sanctioned and authorised by the Client. The Client shall not bring or support any civil claim against the Tester or any member of the Tester's team in respect of Testing conducted within scope. Nothing in this Authorisation prevents either Party from cooperating with law enforcement, regulators, or fulfilling any statutory reporting obligation.

4\. The Client warrants and represents that:

(a) it is the owner of, or has the legal authority to authorise Testing of, the In-Scope Systems;

(b) the In-Scope Systems do not include any systems, infrastructure, or services owned or operated by a third party, except where identified in the SOW and where the Client has obtained the necessary Authorisation from that third party;

(c) the Authorisation extends to all Permitted Activities in the SOW, including activities carried out autonomously by automated tools;

(d) it has obtained all internal approvals necessary to permit Testing, including (where applicable) from its board of directors, IT security team, and any relevant third-party service providers;

(e) _[include where wireless Testing is in scope:]_ the Client has the right to control the operation and use of the relevant wireless systems and consents to the interception and monitoring of communications on those systems for the purposes of Testing;

(f) _[include where social engineering is in scope:]_ phishing emails, vishing calls, pretexting, and other social engineering techniques authorised in the SOW may involve communications that would otherwise be considered offensive or misleading, and the Client authorises the Tester to send such communications to the recipients and using the methods described in the SOW;

(g) _[include where physical Testing is in scope:]_ the Client is the occupier of the premises identified in the Physical Testing Authorisation Schedule (or has the occupier's authority) and authorises the physical access and activities described in that Schedule; and

(h) _[include where Testing involves fabricated Credentials:]_ the Tester is authorised to create and deploy fabricated corporate Credentials (badges, lanyards, contractor passes, visitor badges, business cards) solely for the purposes of Testing. Government-issued identity documents (passports, driving licences, national identity cards) shall not be reproduced or closely imitated. All fabricated materials will be marked with a traceable identifier, logged, and destroyed within 7 days of the Testing Window closing.

5\. Civil liability for Testing conducted outside scope, or for breach of the MSA, is governed by the MSA.

6\. The Client shall indemnify the Tester against losses arising from inaccuracy in the warranties above or failure to obtain third-party consents.

7\. This Authorisation is valid for the Testing Window specified in the SOW. Revocation takes effect upon actual receipt by the Tester lead named in the SOW (or, where sent outside working hours, at 09:00 on the next working day). Revocation does not affect the lawfulness of Testing conducted before it takes effect.
