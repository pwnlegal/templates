# Contributing

These templates improve when practitioners use them and report what works and what doesn't. Contributions are welcome!

## Useful contributions

- **Redlines.** It'd be great to understand how these templates are being used (and adjusted) in the wild. Talk to us on Slack (https://pwnlegal.slack.com/) or open an issue with the file and clause number(s).
- **Error reports.** Broken cross-references, incorrect clause numbers, inconsistencies between documents: please open an issue and tell us what's gone awry.
- **Regulatory updates.** Any legal changes, significant cases or guidance which might impact the approach to contracting. This could include CMA reform, IASME scheme updates, data protection changes, AI regulations, or any other changes impacting the cyber security ecosystem.
- **Missing scenarios.** If you've encountered a commercial situation the templates don't cover (and it's common enough to warrant a standard clause), please describe it.
- **Drafting improvements.** Clearer language, better structure, tighter clauses; pull requests welcome.

## Substantive changes

If a PR changes the legal effect of a clause (not just wording), please explain the rationale for review prior to merging. Note that changes to liability caps, indemnities, authorisation scope, and data protection provisions are expected to be tailored by users, though if there is a good rationale for a change to the template default, let's hear it.

## What won't be merged

- Advertising or promotional content.
- Anything that unjustifiably weakens authorisation protections for practitioners.

## Process

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make changes on a branch.
3. Open a PR with a clear description of what changed and why.
4. For drafting changes, please reference the clause number and explain the intended legal effect.
